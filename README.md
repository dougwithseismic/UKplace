## Browser script instructions (easy)
First, install the [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension:
- [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
 - [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) (ViolentMonkey)

Then just click **[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roshyrowe/UKplace/main/userscript.user.js)**, click "Install", refresh the page and you're good to go!

This script will automate your tile placements according to a template, which we can edit remotely to rapidly push changes.

The code is open source! Inspect it for yourself!







## ALTERNATIVE: Headless script instructions (advanced)

This is intended for cluster users running multiple accounts. If you don't have any technical experience, just use the browser script instead.

3. Refresh the page
